		There many ways that a dog 
		helps out the enviroment. One 
		way that dogs help out with the enviroment
		by being able to smell important plants that
		we need to use for food or anything in general. 
		Another way they help out is by being able to smell 
		drugs from a mile away or close to them. They have 
		an incredible smell that if someone hides a drug in
		the car seat or wheel the dog can sniff it all out.</div>
